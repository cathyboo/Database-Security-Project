**Human Error

One of the biggest threats to computer network security is from authorised users who do not follow proper safety protocol because of a lack of education or carelessness.  Errors by users include;

*Leaving a computer logged in while unattended, for example: if going out for lunch a user does not lock computer.

*Weak password - Use of common or simple password making it easy for hackers to guess.

*Visiting illegitimate websites or downloading malicious attachments.

*Illegitimate disclosure of information, such as a password, to unauthorised personnel.

Email is one of the most common means of virus spread.  Social engineering is used to convince users to open an email and possibly even an extra attachment.  Malicious code can be in HTML form or any type of code can be used in the attachment.

Phishing is another form of email attack that uses social engineering to convince users to hand sensitive information over to a cracker, which they can then use to attack networks and databases.

Instant messages and social networks, like Twitter, are a relatively new route for malicious attacks.  Crackers will again use social engineering to convince users to click on illegitimate links or download malicious software, opening up a network or database to harm.


**Malware Attack;

Although Databases can be configured to only allow local access, increasingly they are placed on the cloud or a specific server, with access allowed through the internet or across a network.  This openness creates possible security threats from malicious planned computer attacks over the network.  Furthermore, increasingly important business, financial and personal information is uploaded into Databases, making them enticing and profitable targets for intruders.

There are over 600,000 malware programs at large on the internet.  Malware is a term for malicious software that is designed by intruders to carry out unauthorized activity on a computer or network, these can often be damaging of destructive to a database.

Malware comes in the following forms;

*Viruses

Viruses are self replicating pieces of software that install themselves on a computer without user consent.  Once installed, they can often carry out harmful attacks, such as stealing memory or CPU activity. They can be very dangerous if they are designed to steal or harm databases.  They can access private information, log keystrokes, corrupt/manipulate data, along with numerous other harmful acts.

Crackers can be very smart about designing viruses to exploit specific security vulnerabilities or use social engineering to fool users into downloading malicious packages.  There are many different types of virus, such as File-infected viruses and Multipartite viruses.

*Trojans

Trojans are malicious programs that disguise themselves as legitimate programs.  Unlike viruses they do not replicate.  They are used to gain access or cause harm to a computer or network.  There are numerous different types of Trojan.

*Worms

Worms can be seen as a specialist version of virus, with the major added danger that they do not need user input to travel from one computer to another.  They are programmed to automatically exploit networks(internet or LAN) and travel from linked device to linked device. Worms are self-learning and will use information on vulnerabilities they found on one computer to infect the next computer on a network.  A worm will repeat the pattern of infecting, learning and spreading until it has potentially destroyed a whole network.

*Spyware

Spyware is a type of virus that monitors your computer use to steal your information without your knowledge.  The information is sent back to the Spyware creator to use as they wish.

*Adware

Adware is like spyware as it can gather information on a user without consent, but it can also be used to display targeted ads to a user, often through the form of pop-up web pages.

*Bots

Bots are malicious programs that install themselves on your computer with the intent of controlling it.  Bots can carry out a wide array of functions.  Bots are controlled by a cracker who may be able to control thousands of computers by infecting them all with Bots.  Together these infected and controlled computers are now called a Botnet.

Bots can be used for a Denial of Service (DOS) attack, where they flood a CPU with requests, slowing it down till it becomes unusable, or else doing the same to a network or database, to shut it down.  They can also be used by their creator to carry out illegal acts like DOS or phishing attacks on other targets.  Bots are difficult to find and hard to remove, often needing the whole OS to be reinstalled so a user can be sure their computer is Bot free.

*SQL Injection

SQL injection is a particular danger to databases and other data driven systems.  It involves malicious SQL statements being inserted into the entry field of a database and then executed.  Hijacking website URLs and sending information through a web-browser is a common attack "vector".  SQL injections can be used to reveal confidential database information to an attacker, or carry out unauthorised manipulation of a database, causing harm to a database.
