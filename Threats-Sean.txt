--Natural Disasters--

Natural Disasters present an uncontrollable threat to the data centers and databases, such incidents include earthquakes, flooding, Hurricanes and fire.The threat presented is twofold there is an immediate threat to any equipment and data present there is also the threat of service downtime. if the databases is critical to a number of onsite or even offsite services any downtime can result in a loss of revenue and customer confidence.

When preventing to attempt damage to data base systems response time is crucial. a fire , for example  can spread quickly through a data centre; causing damage to equipment and endangering personnel. Given the risk associated with a fire, any attempts to tackle a large fire will be carried out by emergency services.This small window is enough time for a fire to cause massive damage to a data centers equipment and to potentially destroy any on site backups.

While Natural Disasters may not necessarily damage the data centre itself it can damage the infrastructure in the surrounding area, as such it is important to keep access to power and telecoms as long as possible .Redundant services may also be used to keep the database up and running  

A recent example of data systems caught in the area of a natural disaster can be seen in the New York area during 2012's Hurricane Sandy.The hurricane itself resulted in a number of data centers in the manhattan area being cut off from power and in some cases telecoms; the subsequent flooding led to damage of essential equipment and services which brought databases offline for a number of weeks until a restoration effort could be carried out.[4]


--Hardware Failure--

Given that most databases will run on a continous basis Hardware failure is an expected consequences of operating a data center.There are a number of hardware copmonents which can fail in a database including Memory,CPU's motherboards and power supplies[9].However the most common component failure comes from hard drives.

Mechanical storage is the most cost effective method for storing large volumes of data on a non volatile medium[2]. Due to the drives structure and moving parts, they are prone to failure as they age.

 


--Human element--

While the security risks dicsussed above primarily deal with elements outside of control there are physical risks to a data center /data base which can come from a human element, these can range from the unitentional to the malicious.

Encryption of data will make it  difficult to glean any sensitive information from stolen hard drives;data bases and larger Data Centres can contain a myriad of high value equipment.This equipment can range from complex networking equipment such as servers and network switches to fibre cable and tools.

Equipment can also be damaged during a break-in ; one such break-in occurred in Vodafoneâ€™s Basingstoke data center in the United Kingdom[8].Thieves caused damage to a number of servers resulting a service outage to Vodafone's voice SMS and internet services.

it is also possible for elements within an organization to present a threat to a database. Sabotage of a database or falsification of the data stored on it by  employees for malicious purposes disruption of services and a loss of data integrity. These acts can be carried out for the purposes of committing fraud or can be purely destructive.It is important to ensure an adequate security system is in place alongside restricting access to only essential staff.
